Scala scale archive
===================

Mirror of the Scala scale archive, version 93, Jan 2025. The original is
available on the Huygens-Fokker Foundation website
[here](https://www.huygens-fokker.org/microtonality/scales.html).

The file `scalesdir.txt` is a contents listing with descriptions. The scl files
themselves are in the `scl` directory.

I've added an [index](scala-scale-index.csv) in csv form containing each scale
along with details including number of notes, period, and prime limit (if
just).

I've converted the files to UTF-8 encoding.
